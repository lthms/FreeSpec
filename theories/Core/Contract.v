(** * Definition *)

(** A contract dedicated to [i : interface] primarily provides two
    predicates.

    - [caller_obligation] distinguishes between primitives that can be used (by
      an impure computation), and primitives that cannot be used.
    - [callee_obligation] specifies which guarantees can be expected from
      primitives results, as computed by a “good” operational semantics.

    Both [caller_obligation] and [callee_obligation] model properties that may
    vary in time, e.g., a primitive may be forbidden at a given time, but
    authorized later.  To take this possibility into account, contracts are
    parameterized by what we have called a “witness.”  A witness is a term which
    describes the necessary information of the past, and allows for taking
    decision for the present.  It can be seen as an abstraction of the concrete
    state of the interface implementor.

    To keep this state up-to-date after each primitive interpretation,
    contracts also define a dedicated function [witness_update]. *)

(** * Composing Contracts *)

(** As we compose interfaces and operational semantics, we can easily compose
    contracts together, by means of the [contractprod] operator. Given [i] and [j]
    two interfaces, if we can reason about [i] and [j] independently (e.g., the
    caller obligations of [j] do not vary when we use [i]), then we can compose
    [ci : contract i Ωi] and [cj : contract j Ωj], such that [contractprod ci cj] in a
    contract for [i + j]. *)

(** * Contract By Example *)

(** Finally, and as an example, we define a contract for the interface
    [STORE s] we discuss in [FreeSpec.Core.Impure].  As a reminder, the
    interface is defined as follows:

<<
Inductive STORE (s : Type) : interface :=
| Get : STORE s s
| Put (x : s) : STORE s unit.
>>

    For [STORE s], the best witness is the actual value of the mutable
    variable.  Therefore, the contract for [STORE s] may be [specs (STORE
    s) s], and the witness will be updated after each [Put] call. *)

Definition store_update (s : Type) :=
  fun (x : s) (α : Type) (e : STORE s α) (_ : α) =>
    match e with
    | Get => x
    | Put x' => x'
    end.

(** Assuming the mutable variable is being initialized prior to any impure
    computation interpretation, we do not have any obligations over the use of
    [STORE s] primitives.  We will get back to this assertion once we have
    defined our contract, but in the meantime, we define its callee obligation.

    The logic of these callee obligations is as follows: [Get] is expected to
    produce a result strictly equivalent to the witness, and we do not have any
    obligations about the result of [Put] (which belongs to [unit] anyway, so
    there is not much to tell). *)

Inductive o_callee_store (s : Type) (x : s) : forall (α : Type), STORE s α -> α -> Prop :=
| get_o_callee (x' : s) (equ : x = x') : o_callee_store s x s Get x'
| put_o_callee (x' : s) (u : unit) : o_callee_store s x unit (Put x') u.

(** The actual contract can therefore be defined as follows: *)

Definition store_specs (s : Type) : contract (STORE s) s :=
  {| witness_update := store_update s
  ;  caller_obligation := no_caller_obligation
  ;  callee_obligation := o_callee_store s
  |}.

(** Now, as we briefly mentionned, this contract allows for reasoning about an
    impure computation which uses the [STORE s] interface, assuming the mutable,
    global variable has been initialized.  We can define another contract that
    does not rely on such assumption, and on the contrary, requires an impure
    computation to initialize the variable prior to using it.

    In this context, the witness can solely be a boolean which tells if the
    variable has been initialized, and the [callee_obligation] will require the
    witness to be [true] to authorize a call of [Get].

    This is one of the key benefits of the FreeSpec approach: because the
    contracts are defined independently from impure computations and
    interfaces, we can actually define several contracts to consider
    different set of hypotheses. *)
